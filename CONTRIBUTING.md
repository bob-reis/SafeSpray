## Development Setup
- Requirements: Node 18+, npm.
- Install: `npm install`
- Dev server: `npm run dev` â†’ http://localhost:3000
- Build: `npm run build`

## Coding Standards
- TypeScript + React (App Router).
- 2-space indentation, no one-letter names.

- Add unit tests for `_lib/` and component behavior.
- Minimum coverage target: 80% (CI enforces coverage reporting).
- Run locally: `npm run test:coverage`.

## Git & Commits
- Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add team combos`).
- Keep PRs focused; one logical change per PR.
- Update docs for UI/behavior changes.

## Pull Requests
- Fill the PR template: summary, scope, tests, screenshots.
- Link related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
- Ensure CI passes (lint, tests, build, SonarCloud scan).

## Ethics & Security
- Never add network calls to process user inputs.
- Respect privacy; keep processing client-side.
- Features must reinforce ethical, authorized use.
